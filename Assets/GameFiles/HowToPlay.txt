Welcome to Leaky Kittens!

In this game you subscribe to the mission of getting more and more little kittens house trained.
To accomplish this end your have to gently point them in the direction of their destination: the cat tray.

But, be vigilant! The kittens will arrive on the map still very leaky. 
They will leave behind one puddle of pee after another. 
Swipe them away and you will be rewarded with experience points.
If you ignore them that will do no good...

How to move the kittens?

Kittens will always move in the opposite direction of where you point - or walk and pee randomly around the house when you don't take care of them.
Unfortunately they are not very willing to use the cat tray... 

So, to get them in the right direction put your finger gently behind a little kitten.
The closer your finger is to a kitten the faster it will move to the opposite side. 
You can keep touching the screen or let go from to time to time.
If you do kittens will run a bit further - you can take advantage of that circumstance.

If you manage to move a kitten to the cat tray (the blue box with yellow sand in it) you have successfully trained it and you will be rewarded with more experience points.
You can complete a level if you have trained all the kittens on the map.
But be wary, there is a time limit!

How to get rid of the pee puddles?

Put your finger on the position of the puddle. 
Swipe back and forth or keep touching the screen on that position for a second and than swipe quickly with a big stroke in one direction and it will vanish from the map.

Now, have fun enjoying the kitten madness as their numbers increase and the obstacles along the way!
